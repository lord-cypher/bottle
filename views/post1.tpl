<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
	So I have accomplished various things recently.
</p>

<p>It all started when I started using youtube-dl.</p>

<p>It didn't work at first but after fixing the error with updating arch, I then managed to successfully update youtube-dl</p>

<p>From there I managed to download my entire youtube music library.</p>

<p>After this I started using vlc as my music player but I found it inadaquete as anyone would.</p>

<p>I then started configuring mpd, mpc and ncmpcpp.</p>

<p>Now I have successfully done that.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>I have cleaned up my projects file, and now I have undertaken several projects.</p>

<p>C, C++, Python, web server, BCHS, etc.</p>

<p>Installing openbsd and then having to use VI. Insanity</p>

<p>lots of fun</p>
